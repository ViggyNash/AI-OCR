Training.py:
	Arguments: 
		training data file: path for training data file
		training label file: path for training label file 
		training model: ML Model to train ('bayes', 'perceptron', 'other')

	Functions:
		extract:
			input: 	1
				training data segment (char[][])
			return: 1
				feature values for segment (int[])
