1) Build block feature detection
2/3) Build Bayes/Perceptron

UPDATE:
1) Change extract function so that every 'pixel' is a separate feature
2) Test/fix driver
3/4) Test Perceptron and Bayes
5) Look into MIRA and Nearest Neighbor algorithms

To decide later:
	Do we want to do horizontal component counting for feature detection in numbers? (Only if we get bad accuracy for numbers)
	What will our third model be? (MIRA vs Nearest Neighbor)
	Gradient-based block feature detection? (likely no)
